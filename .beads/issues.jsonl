Until this is live, API keys have to be manually managed on each machine, defeating the purpose of chezmoi.

{"id":"dotfiles-pm3","title":"CLI menu-driven machine type selection for chezmoi init","description":"Add an interactive CLI menu during chezmoi init that asks what 'type' of machine is being provisioned (e.g. personal, work, server/minimal). On a work machine, all config should be applied but application installation should be selective — skip most Brewfile apps and VS Code extensions, but still install 'essential' software. This requires: (1) a chezmoi template prompt or init script that sets a machine_type data field, (2) conditional logic in Brewfile.tmpl to split packages into essential vs full, (3) conditional VS Code extension installation, (4) persisting the choice in .chezmoi.toml so subsequent applies respect it.","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"github@pmgledhill.com","created_at":"2026-02-24T08:43:53.042158Z","created_by":"Paul Gledhill","updated_at":"2026-02-25T18:05:50.058998Z","closed_at":"2026-02-25T18:05:50.058998Z","close_reason":"Implemented in PR #35","labels":["chezmoi","multi-machine","onboarding"]}
