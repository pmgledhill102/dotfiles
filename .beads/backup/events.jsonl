For a personal dotfiles repo, much of this is over-engineered. Propose a trimmed documentation set. Candidates for trimming/merging: MIGRATION.md (one-time use, could become a section in README), BACKUP_RECOVERY.md (mostly theoretical — keep age key backup essentials, drop the rest). The root README.md is currently empty and should become the primary entry point covering: what this repo is, quickstart install, what's included (tools/platforms), machine types, and links to detailed docs.
