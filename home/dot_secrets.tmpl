# This file is a placeholder for secrets.
# The actual secrets are managed by chezmoi with age encryption.
# For example, you can create an encrypted file with:
# chezmoi add --encrypt ~/.secrets
# This will create a file in your source directory like:
# private_dot_secrets.age
#
# When you run `chezmoi apply`, it will decrypt this file and place the
# contents in `~/.secrets`.
